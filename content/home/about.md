# Biography

Greetings, I am a postdoctoral fellow researching leukemia at Oregon Health & Science University, slowly metamorphosing into a full-fledged Data scientist in my spare time. I started teaching myself R and SQL in 2016 before completing my PhD in Cancer Biology at OHSU in 2017. I'm excited to have a place to share my work and interested in new connections or opportunities.
